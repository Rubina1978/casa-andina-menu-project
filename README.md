After practicing on Free Code Camp doing restaurant meny to improve CSS knowledge, I thought I will try to replicate what I have learned by creating my own restaurant menu. It is based on my Travel and Torism project during studies when we learned how to setup business and had to come up with idea of business. I have returned from Peru shortly before the study and the name was a name of local canteen for disadvantaged children so I took it as inspiration.
